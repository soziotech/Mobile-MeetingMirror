Munich is Germany&#8217;s third largest city and the capital of the state of Bavaria. It is located on the river Isar north of the Bavarian Alps. Munich is known for beautiful architecture, fine culture and a relaxed way of life with a unique southern flair. Its beer gardens make it particularly attractive in the summer. The nearby Alps provide ample opportunities for outdoor activities and its cultural scene and museums attract many visitors year-round. Munich is also a major international center of business, engineering and science. It has an efficient public transport system of buses, trams, subways and local trains, which makes reaching every part of the city fast and easy. Summers in the city are usually warm and pleasant with an average maximum of about 24 °C (75 °F).
